### Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I update ursina?

```
pip install https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/archive/master.zip --upgrade
```


## How should I structure my project?

```
project_folder/         # create a new folder for each project
    enemies.py
    level.py
    main.py             # the starting script
    player.py
    player_sprite.png
    textures/           # assets can be placed alongside the scripts or in a folder below
        enemy_1.png
        enemy_2.png
```




## How do I move the camera?

The camera is an Entity, so you can move and rotate it just like everything else:
    ```
    camera.position = Vec3(1,1,0)
    ```



## Why should I use Python for game development. Isn't it slow?

Not really. The most performance critical part are written in C++ or shader code.
Python can make you more productive as a developer and thus make it easier
to structure your project in a good way, rather than micro-optimize.




## How do I call a function with a delay?</b>

```
invoke(some_function, arg1, kwarg1='some kwarg', delay=2)
```



## How do I add lights?

If all you want are some simple lights to make 3D shapes look more interesting,
look at the program 'lights.py' in the samples folder.  For anything more complicated,
you are on your own. The DirectionalLight has shadows too, but it's recommended to use the
lit_with_shadows_shader on entities. The shadow area will be calculated based on the scene bounds,
so keep that in mind when isinstanciation the light.




## How can I use panda3d alongside ursina?

What you need to know is that Entity is a NodePath and Ursina is a ShowBase.
You can also write custom shaders, see panda3d's shader documentation for that.
