### Text

## Text Size

Set .scale or .world_scale:
```
text_entity = Text('hello', scale=2)
```

## Font and Resolution

For one Text Entity:

```
text = Text(font='VeraMono.ttf', resolution=100*Text.size)
text.text = descr
```

For all Text Entities:

```
Text.default_font = 'VeraMono.ttf'
Text.default_resolution = 100 * Text.size
```

Keep in mind you don't *have* to change the resolution, but for pixel fonts for example, you
might want a higher resolution in order for it to not appear blurry.

## Text Alignment

Change text alignment by setting .origin:
```
Text('Hello\nWorld!', origin=(-.5,.5))  # the default. text starts in the upper left like normal.
Text('Hello\nWorld!', origin=(0,0))     ``` is centered both horizontally and vertically.
```


## Text Colors

Set .color to color the whole text.
```
t = Text('This is some text', color=color.blue)
```

Use tags to color parts of the text.
```
t = Text('This is some <pink>colored text. <default>Reset color back to default.', color=color.blue)
```

## Changing Text of Prefabs

Things like Slider, InputField, etc., usually has .text_entity which you can access if you need it.
